# MEGAN x MEDUSA Comparison
This repository has the scripts used to compare the taxonomic and functional results produced by MEGAN and MEDUSA.

To run the scripts and reproduce the results you need to execute the script **01-InstallDependencies.R** (Scripts folder).

For further inspections, the raw FASTQ files from all datasets are also available in the Data folder.
